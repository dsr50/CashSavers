I'm currently creating a website in my spare time that will be used at a grocery store named Cash Savers. This started out as a simple project to make a website while I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to create a website that will host the neccesaties one could expect to find while browsing the internet in search for our grocery store. I will also be working on creating an online schedule that will host the weekly schedule for our employees that will intergrate with Google Calander and have the ability to send the schedule through SMS.
